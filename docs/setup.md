# Setup

To launch the Tuner application from a local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal and run `node server/index.js` from the top-most (tuner) directory to start the application
2. The application should now be live at <http://localhost:3000>
   - Note that the `port` number may be different if the `process.env.PORT` is set to something other than 3000

To close the Tuner application, simply exit the terminal used to start the app or input `CTRL` + `C` in the same terminal
