# Gimel Grading Rubric

|         | Functionality | User Interface | Documentation & Repository | Implementation & Innovation |
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **0**       | The application does not provide any useful functionality/bugs prevent all of the functionality. | The application is unusable due to the incompetence of the user interface. Meaningless stylistic choices made. | No documentation/ incorrect documentation. The repository is entirely unstructured and is missing the most basic features/ files. | None of the described features were implemented/ no application idea that makes sense. |
| **1**       | The application features are in large part prevented by bugs and instabilities. These mostly prevent the application from reaching the goal/ objective. | The user interface is significantly flawed: spacing and positioning choices of the application components constantly distract the user from the main content or prevent from interaction altogether. | The documentation is very lacking in both  detail and accuracy. Most features like the CRUD are not explained. Repository has a mostly convoluted structure which requires some cleanup. | Large part of the described  features was not implemented in the application. The implemented parts contain a variety of different bugs making the code convoluted. The overall app idea needs serious work. |
| **2**       | The application performs with few glitches. Few aspects responsible for basic usage of the website do not work/ prevent from reaching the goal/objective. | The user interface is mostly sensible and provides for a good way to navigate/interact with the features. Some features may be missing or inconsistent/ have one or two unattractive design choices. |  Some aspects of the application are missing from the documentation. Imperfect github repository with unexplained/ ambiguous commits or a few files in a convoluted structure. | Some of the features claim functionality in the description but actually were not implemented. Source code contains some bugs. The app is lacking some obvious creative touch that would make it more unique/interesting |
| **3**       | The application performs as expected. Users are able to utilize the applications features and functionalities without any bugs or problems. The application also provides a goal/objective that can be applied to a modern-day problem. | The user interface is easy to navigate and provides a simple and clean view of the application and its components / features. The intention of each view and its component are clear,concise, and self-explanatory. | Documentation clearly outlines the application’s functionalities, features, and implementations. The repository is well organized and separated into distinct directories that allow for easy navigation between the application’s components. | All of the proposed/described features and functionalities of the application have all been successfully implemented. The source code is clear and concise. The app idea is unique and interesting. |
